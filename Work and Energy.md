# Work and Energy
Work is the amount of energy transferred from one system to the other.
$$W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{r}$$
Simple example from Kinematics:

$\theta$ is the angle between F & d (three situations):

# Electric fields
Pay attention to the agent that is doing work and in what direction it is in.

## What if force varies?
$$W=\int\vec F \cdot d\vec r$$
