# Statics
## Any Origin Trick
For objects in equilibrium, if you take the net torque about a point to be 0, at any other point, the net torque is still 0.

>[!idea]
>Consider the torques from an origin that sets most of them equal to 0.

>[!example] Application
>- Specifically, take note of the torques that you *don’t* want to solve for and find a pivot point that **cancels them out** (extend the force lines and find intersection)

**Example**: common ladder setup

- Choose the origin at the bottom of the ladder where there are forces from friction and normal force.
- Another point could be where the two normal forces intersect (outside the ladder)

## Virtual Work Trick
>[!idea]
If $U(x) = 0$, then the net force equals 0 and it is at equilibrium (basically any max/min point on the graph)

 >[!example] Application
 Perturb system by $\derivative x$, then compute the amount of “virtual work” using the forces, setting it equal to 0 (net work = U)

**Example**: informative springs question from F=ma

## Force Trick
>[!idea]
Sum of the **normal** force and saturated **friction** force (at maximum) equals a force that is at an angle $\arctan(\mu)$.

**Example**: hunk of ice being pushed down
