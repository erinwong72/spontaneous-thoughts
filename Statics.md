# Statics
## Any Origin Trick
For objects in equilibrium, if you take the net torque about a point to be 0, at any other point, the net torque is still 0.

**Example**: common ladder setup

- Choose the origin at the bottom of the ladder where there are forces from friction and normal force.
- Another point could be where the two normal forces intersect (outside the ladder)
