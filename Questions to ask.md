1. Will we be working with any high performance computing cluster or supercomputer?
2. What should I do to follow up after this interview?

Why I'm interested?
Global warming has increased significantly over the past 20 years and the rising sea levels that accompany the warming of the Earth may eventually lead to the submerging of many coastal areas. This along with the world’s growing population (among other factors) propels a new era of space exploration for habitable planets. Because of the vast amount of data from telescopes identifying potential planets, machine learning is the perfect solution, maximizing the efficiency with which Earth-like planets can be identified. I have seen how capable machines are at optimizing and predicting trends through my research in pedestrian trajectory prediction at the CSIRE program at Stony Brook under Professor Susu Xu. Furthermore, I have experience designing models to account for instrument noise or other phenomena: I have done computational neuroscience research under Professor Tatiana Engel at Princeton University requiring the filtering of noisy data in EEG and EMG recordings. I hope to apply my skills and interests to a problem that is very personal to me—I live in a coastal area on Long Island which is at risk of being submerged by the end of the century due to global warming.
