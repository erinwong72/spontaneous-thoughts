# Energy-band structure

In a material, this determines the energy levels electrons can occupy.

1. **Valence** band: most/all electrons, if not excited, are in this band, most stably bound to nucleus
2. **Conduction** band: when electrons are excited, they move up in energy level to this band where they can conduct electricity because they can freely move 

**Band gap**/energy gap is the difference in energy between valence and conduction band, or how much energy is needed to excite an electron into the conduction band from the valence. The lower the band gap, the better a conductor the material is.
