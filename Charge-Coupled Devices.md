# Charge-Coupled Devices

CCDs are a type of solid-state detector, basically a semiconductor.

It works by detecting the movement and presence of **electron-hole pairs** (lack of electrons in the valence band) in the [[Energy-band structure]] when electrons are excited to the conduction band. These pairs are normally created when photons (carrying energy) strike the surface.

The electron-hole pairs accompany electrons that have moved to the conduction band, which creates charges, stored and accumulated in potential charge well based on light intensities. Images can then be reconstructed.
