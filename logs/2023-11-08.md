# Thoughts for the day...
## PINN implementation
I might want to try He initialization for sigma0 as well, instead of randn → it seems to prevent the “inf, nan, nan …” from happening as often.

Started running a model on seawulf for 500 epochs, had to restart (as in re-initialize the weights) multiple times.

Actually, the problem ended up being the ground truth 💀 -- we forgot to check how it really looked like -- instead of just varying intercenter distance, we varied the orientations as well by generating centers (of the second ellipsoid in any location in a sphere around the first ellipsoid).

Bad graph:

- Looks like this because it’s many LJP curve superimposed on each other (of different distances away and orientations)
