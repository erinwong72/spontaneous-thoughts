# Thoughts for the day...

>[!thoughts]
>It’s been a rough two weeks: I’ve worked tirelessly on my research project (the Drosophila one), kept up with school, and I can’t remember the last time I went to sleep before 1 AM. When I finally submitted the application (to AAN Neuroscience Research Prize), nothing happened. Not even a sigh of relief. I had a sketchnote to design and explain due by the next morning and was at a loss for how to even begin. You would’ve thought that I would get a break. Perhaps I would be able to go hang out with my friends for once! But no, life went on, deadlines kept coming, so I stayed at my desk, working.

^ My attempt at summarizing my feelings over the past two weeks in a *dramatic* or *elegant* way (developing writer’s skills when?).

On another note, I’m keeping the momentum going with research:

## LC Responses
Finally synced the laptop to github repo, now both PC and laptop are synced up.
- It’s probably a good point to refactor the code

Mainly worked on cleaning up the repo today, and making sure everything is synced together (including trying git-lfs).
### Re-making new stimuli
What on earth is Jon doing in his preprocessing scripts?

For each stim:
```python
num_samples = int(Hz*trim[1])-int(Hz*trim[0])
times = np.linspace(trim[0], trim[1], num_samples)
f = interpolate.interp1d(np.linspace(
            0, stim_time, resized_images.shape[-1]), resized_images, axis=-1, fill_value='extrapolate')
```
- stim_time: float: 6
- resized_images: one numpy array corresponding to one stimulus, reshaped, assuming -1 refers to the time dimension (it should)

```python
lookback = np.linspace(trim[0]-memory/Hz, trim[0]-1/Hz, memory)
X_interp = f(np.hstack([lookback, times]))
X_interp = np.array([X_interp[:, :, i-memory:i]
                            for i in range(memory, X_interp.shape[-1])])
```
- memory: int = 10
- trim: tuple, [1,6] (to make everything aligned, just getting rid of the first second)
- Hz: float, 15

Gonna yoink his nice video-from-numpy-array generation code:
```python
def images_to_vid(arr: np.array, out_file: str, Hz: float):
    height, width = arr.shape[:2]
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
    out = cv2.VideoWriter(out_file, fourcc, Hz, (width, height), isColor=False)  
    for frame in range(arr.shape[-1]):
        out.write(arr[:,:,frame].astype(np.uint8))
    out.release()
```

	- Bruh. batch response: This repository is over its data quota. Account responsible for LFS bandwidth should purchase more data packs to restore access.
	- even bigger bruh: I may have just deleted my whole repo ;-;
	- Well just the results, but ig it’s ok because I was going to have to re-make them again
	- I deeply regret using/attempting to use LFS
		- BAD IDEA!!!
