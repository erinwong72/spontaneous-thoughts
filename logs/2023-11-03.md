# Thoughts for the day...
It’s been a rough two weeks: I’ve worked tirelessly on my research project (the Drosophila one), kept up with school, and I can’t remember the last time I went to sleep before 1 AM. When I finally submitted the application (to AAN Neuroscience Research Prize), nothing happened. Not even a sigh of relief. I had a sketchnote to design and explain due by the next morning and was at a loss for how to even begin. You would’ve thought that I would get a break. Perhaps I would be able to go hang out with my friends for once! But no, life went on, deadlines kept coming, so I stayed at my desk, working.

^ My attempt at summarizing my feelings over the past two weeks in a *dramatic* or *elegant* way (developing writer’s skills when?).
