Possible papers that can be used to support rationale behind feature detection:
- [Feature Detection - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/feature-detection) -- I.C. Whitefield, contributions to sensory physiology, elucidates feature detection in auditory cortex but definition still applies
	- Should find one that describes it in the visual system
	- Can reference Hubel and Weisel’s description of primary visual cortex V1 neurons and claim that it applies to visual system too, as well as in organisms besides mammals (cite Wu or Ming et al, whichever one claimed to discover LC cells to detect features)
- [The human visual system - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128203538000116) -- outlines how outputs from feature detectors compete to be encoded and interpreted, related to visual **attention**
- [Feature-based attention in visual cortex: Trends in Neurosciences](https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(06)00087-7) -- consequence of learning more about feature detectors → can explain feature-based attention better
