# Thoughts for the day...
## PINN implementation
I was able to  “reconstruct” the virtual environment by referencing my conda environment .yml (setup) file from my ML machine.
- Ran the scripts again for 100 points to generate actual ground truth data this time

## LC Responses
Jon found a problem with the stimuli -- they are not consistent with the showing of the gray background (the looming spot didn’t have, for example, even though I fixed the gratings).

Using the same technique before: save pre+post stimuli as a separate file, then just append it to both ends of the main stimulus.
