# Thoughts for the day...
## PINN implementation
I was able to  “reconstruct” the virtual environment by referencing my conda environment .yml (setup) file from my ML machine.
- Ran the scripts again for 100 points to generate actual ground truth data this time

## LC Responses
Jon found a problem with the stimuli -- they are not consistent with the showing of the gray background (the looming spot didn’t have, for example, even though I fixed the gratings).

Using the same technique before: save pre+post stimuli as a separate file, then just append it to both ends of the main stimulus.
- Ended up regenerating the rest of the stimuli just to be consistent, now just combining into one big file on my own server

Now in the process of converting the jupyter notebook code into python scripts for running on the larger server.

Choosing a new learning rate: 7e-4 seems to do pretty well (only running for 50 epochs though on one model).
- Might eventually want to use a hyperparameter optimization package like wandb

Choosing a conda environment to use for training:
- tensorflow, tensorflow1.4 envs cannot import tf
- tensorflow2-gpu doesn’t have sklearn
- I’ll have to create my own virtual environment…I think
- No, actually the problem was loading cuda and cudnn:
