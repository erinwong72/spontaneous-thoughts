# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-10-03]]
## LJP
Honestly I feel really bad for having not worked on the project for so long… but that changes TODAY.

Mostly working on stuff for tomorrow’s meeting (based off Dylan’s progress this week)
- Figure out how sigma varies with N:
	- Through fitting the LJP curve for every N value
- Dylan’s parameters:
	- (1.0, 2.0, 0.5)
	- 5000 reference points
	- Intercenter distance of 4 units

First generated new reference points (again) using Dylan’s parameters.
- Noticed that the LJP values were too small

	- Yup, 4 units is definitely too far away
	- ![[Pasted image 20231003230414.png|328]]
		- This is better, with intercenter distance of 2.5

Stuff to do tomorrow:
- [ ] Generate error curves for point values from 1000 to 5000 in 250 invervals
- [ ] Find optimal value of sigma for each that leads to the average LJP seen in the reference
