# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-16]]
## LJP
- I checked on the results for the PINN model run— it failed to save the losses (bc I was doing the github stuff yesterday)— but the results were pretty bad because the loss once again spiked at around 630-something, from 0.04 to 56.
	- Running the PINN again from epoch 0, to epoch 1000

## Date Palm Analysis
- Last-minute attempt to finish at least something before my meeting tomorrow with Dr. Flowers
- Set new threshold to 0.99 to make sure only the best fit is passed through, then save the whole area
	- Tried visualizing the numpy array to see if manual boundaries can be seen
	- Maybe???
- Also currently trying to get smaller “templates” for the inner squares, but I’ll probably call it a day now and go to sleep
