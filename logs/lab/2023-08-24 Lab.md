# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-24]]
## LJP
- I tried Prof Deng’s suggestion of using the exact values as used in the paper and comparing the graphs again (1.875, 2.025, 0.475)
- Seawulf still hasn’t finished generating the reference values and timed out after the queue ran out of time—likely need to use at least the long core

## Date Palm Image Analysis
- Continued working on things for the meeting tomorrow
- On Monday I got an image of four squares on a transparent background, so I’m trying to see if the code can still match it
	- Got an error: cv2.error: OpenCV(4.6.0) /Users/xperience/actions-runner/_work/opencv-python/opencv-python/opencv/modules/imgproc/src/color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cvtColor'
	- As I suspected, converting from color to grayscale doesn’t support the transparent/alpha channels, so extract out alpha channels first

```python
template = cv2.imread('template.png', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)
alpha_channel = template[:, :, 3]
```

- Why did I not realize earlier that the colors I chose need to actually be side-by-side in order for the software to even match???
	- ![[template_4.png]] (revised version, tried to make the borders the same width too)
	- Well, looks like it can’t really match transparent pixels
- What if we convert all pixels on the border to transparent? Then maybe it’s easier to detect edges — this is **after** getting the matched area
	- Re-making the template image so that it’s not tilted
		- ![[IMG_0435-fotor-2023082414350.png|123]]
		- One pitfall, it might not always identify the area at all, either because the template was made from another variety (perhaps proving that there is some difference) or because it’s too specific (i.e. too cropped?)
	- Yup, back to edge detection, this time, trying different combinations of blurring and edge detection algorithms
		- What if I find out the shape of the matched template and then run edge detection to get the main box
			- Basically just need to find the area of the big green rectangle
				- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-24 at 2.22.22 PM.png|475]]
				- Based on it being the “largest” contour, I didn’t actually need to get the shape, I could use `cv2.contourArea` on the largest one and set a boundary definition of $\pm 100$ pixels
			- Got it working, now it can find the box in any image
