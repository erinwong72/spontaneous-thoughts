# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-17]]
## Date Palm Image Analysis
### Meeting with Dr. Flowers
- Simplifying problem: take 4 colors and make borders transparent around four squares
	- Perhaps use Adobe Illustrator/Fiji
		- Use a shape tool, draw a box around one of the squares, create a clipping mask (4 masks for 4 different colors, and make spaces in between for transparency) → “how to make a clipping mask”
	- Can it identify discontinuous set of matches
- Plot distribution of colors in the block
- Use mode as metric

## LJP
- Catching up on what I’ve missed
- PINN model still hasn’t finished training 1000 epochs 😡 — stopped after 8 hours because of runtime issues
	- Editing code to save losses and training output after every epoch instead of after the whole run → basically append to existing csv file after first epoch
	- Used conditionals to avoid duplicating code
	- Let’s see if this runs on the first try… yay it does!!! 🎉🥳
		- Nevermind ;-; I have to change the save file to not change every epoch (use starting epoch instead of current epoch, which were under the same variable name before)
		- Bruh the horrendously large and not-getting-smaller numbers are there again 💀; it wouldn’t be a day working on this project without that happening → restarting the run to see if it systematically occurs or if it’s just poor weight initialization
- Test black box model on semi-axis lengths fixed
	- Generating semi-axis lengths dataset:
		- No case 1, case 2, case 3, just one large case
		- Fix the semi-axes lengths to (1, 0.5, 0.2) for both ellipsoids so that the model only focuses on positions and orientations
			- Even randomizes center, with the “circle” technique mentioned as a comment in the code, except tailored for my ellipsoids’ parameters

>[!quote]+
> Generate coordinates for second ellipsoid center point. (The first ellipsoid is always  centered at the origin). In cases where all axes lengths are <= 1, the ljp tends to converge to 0 by a distance between centers of approximately 5. So for the second ellipsoid's center point, we generate a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">random point inside a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin, but outside a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin</mark>, to ensure that the ellipsoids do not touch but the distance between their center points is no greater than 5.

- Test black box model on large dataset with and without L-BFGS
	- Basically a bunch of copypasta, merging PINN code for L-BFGS, the BB-case model, etc.
