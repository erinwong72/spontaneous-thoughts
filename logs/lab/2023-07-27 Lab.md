# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-07-27]]
## Fibrinogen
- Fixed problem I had yesterday with the energy minimization function
	- ![[2023-07-26 Lab#^faf550]]
	- [[Writing an energy minimization config file]]
- [[Writing an equilibration config file]]
- Worked on and finished the presentation (for tomorrow)
- Tried setting up PLA and $C_e$ domains for interaction:
	- For simulating this part, it will be a *biphasic* system (hydrophobic part and water): [Building Biphasic Systems](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/biphasic/01_genconf.html)
	- Got this error when trying to run the [[pdb2gmx function]] on the pla.pdb file Bernard gave me:
		- `Fatal error: Residue 'LIG' not found in residue topology database`
		- Treat the PLA as a ligand: [Protein-Ligand Complex](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/complex/02_topology.html)
			1. (Using CHARMM36 force field) Download toppar additional files for proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids
				1. How to use?: [CHARMM FF files](http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml)
					1. Install networkx package, v=2.3
					2. Download cgenff_charmm2gmx conversion file
			2. Delete PLA to get monomer, then use CGenFF
			3. Instead of one molecule, put however many PLA monomers you use
		- Make a box large enough to fit the PLA plus some space on the sides (see if gives errors)
			- Also protein must be able to fit into the space left over from the PLA
	- Use VMD to gauge size of box: ~1 nm space between PLA and protein

## LJP
- Finished presentation
	- Added objectives/aim and clarified Monte Carlo integration
