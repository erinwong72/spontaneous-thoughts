# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-26]]
## GenAI For DD
- Yesterday I offered to do an md-run on 4EGI, a binding inhibitor, so I’ll get started on that first
	- Looks like this in Chimera:
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-26 at 10.25.32 AM.png|350]]
	- Waiting on what force field to use, but I’ll stick to charmm36 for now
	- Also deciding on whether or not to remove the crystal waters (the red dots in the image) but to be safe, I’ll leave them in and just equilibrate everything for a longer period of time
	- Now I got this error when generating a topology:
		- `Residue 2 named GLN of a molecule in the input file was mapped to an entry in the topology database, but the atom CG used in that entry is not found in the input file. Perhaps your atom and/or residue naming needs to be fixed.`
		- I’ll do some investigation in Chimera: tried using addH
			- It might be because there are entries under MissingAtoms and MissingResidues sections
			- Can fix this using PyMol or Modeller: [[Fixing missing atoms or residues in PDB structures]]
			- Ran into a problem where the aspartic acid didn’t have a nitrogen 🤦‍♀️ → just deleted it and added it back using builder
			- I’M SO DUMB!!!! I TRIED BUILDING ON THE NITROGENS FOR THE C-TERMINI 😭😭😭
		- After adding loop regions for the missing residues: 
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-26 at 12.49.52 PM.png|250]]
		- After refinement in ModLoop
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-26 at 1.07.41 PM.png|275]]
			- Superposition of before refinement and residue fixing and after (beige = before, pink = after) → it’s probably ready now

	- I started my equilibration and since the protein is super small, it only took a few seconds:

			- Converged super quick, and to a reasonably low potential too!

## LJP
- Got a quick update on generating the reference values: 
	- It started 10 hours ago and looks pretty good so far (it’s almost done with the 1st case, generated 85/100 values)
	- But, then I thought about whether or not I was doing it correctly: ==Would it be better to get it to sample out of a given set of distances (like 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.) so that it's easier to compare when generating the error curves?==
		- Yeah, Giorgos also prefers a more systematic approach like this
- I realized that the reason why there was no header for the csv of generated data: I made the condition that r had to be 0 (never), not the first **index** ;-;
- Also, when I replaced my implementation with Giorgos’, so now I don’t have to put in double the # of particles to get what I want inside the ellipsoid
- I implemented the “systematic approach” using `np.linspace` (I first tried `np.arange` but that didn’t produce the results I wanted) with a 0.1 increment
