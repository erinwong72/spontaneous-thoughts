# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-02]]
## LJP
- Added a second dataset class to deal with the other type of dataset (the larger one where there are no ‚Äúlist columns‚Äù except for the center one)
- Also added an implementation that keeps the lists together ‚Üí seems to perform the same
- Trying to get jupyter notebooks working on Seawulf (taking advantage of the resources)
	- [[Using jupyter notebooks on HPC]] ‚Üê got it running ü•≥
	- But why is my own PC faster üò≠

## Fibrinogen
- Working on resolving seawulf issue: referencing [How to use MatLab on Seawulf | Division of Information Technology](https://it.stonybrook.edu/help/kb/how-to-use-matlab-on-seawulf)
	- Need to start interactive session using salloc:
	- ```bash
	  module load slurm
	  salloc -N 1 --ntasks-per-node=28 -p short-40core
	  ssh -X $SLURM_NODELIST
	  ```
  - Error still persists:
	  - `gmx: error while loading shared libraries: libomp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
	  - Loading both the regular gromacs module AND the intel epyc one seems to kinda work?
		  - Trying just intel epyc ‚Üí gmx command is not recognized
		  - Solved it by updating .bashrc and .bash_profile! ‚Üí [[GROMACS on Seawulf]]
  - Rerunning the nvt and npt equilibration (might have gone wrong last time I did it) on interactive short-40core
	  - If not doing debugging or setting up the equilibration and such, don‚Äôt use the interactive one and instead use the queue (sbatch)
	  - Finished rerunning nvt‚Äînot being able to plot points was probably because I set `nstxout`, `nstenergy`, etc. to 0
	  - Also finished rerunning npt

			  - Pressure should vary quite a lot so this looks fine
		  - ![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 8.21.03 PM.png|375]]
			  - Density looks stable enough
  - Starting MD simulation for central E domain alone (solvated)
	  - Made .mdp file (essentially the same as the npt one), make sure there are NO POSITION RESTRAINTS
- Working on resolving the issue of mismatched number of molecules
	- Meeting with Bernard

## Date Palm Image Analysis
- Looked into using template matching (where you give the algorithm a template that you want to select from the greater image‚Äîthis would be the color grid) in open cv
	- Cropped out the color grid from one of the date palm images
	- Pretty nice results:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230802164542.png|350]]
	- Now adding on edge detection
		- Looking a lil wonky:
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 5.00.18 PM.png|350]]
		- Maybe doing it without converting to gray in the middle is better (on HSV)
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 5.08.32 PM.png|350]]
			- Nope, not really
	- What about just color clustering? (should ideally cluster into 24 colors)
		- Using kmeans clustering from sci-kit learn, 24 clusters ‚Üí ~30 minutes
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 7.09.08 PM.png|350]]
			- Reconstructed from clusters‚Äîseems to do the job well
				- Trying to clustering into 25, since the grey bar at the bottom is included, so that it doesn‚Äôt skew anything
					- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 8.08.23 PM.png|400]]
						- Looks much better (with the value of the white, especially)
			- Now I just have to extract the white (or check the other ones too)
