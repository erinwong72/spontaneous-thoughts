# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-09]]
## Fibrinogen
- With the help of Bernard, I was able to “fix” the weird looking RMSD plot:
	- Consolidated into here → [[Molecular dynamics run (MDrun) analysis]]
- Worked on poster board
	- Made some nice figures using biorender

		- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 7.32.21 PM.png|200]]
- Analyzed results from equilibration
	- Density hasn’t really settled, so I might have to run for a bit longer.

		- Running npt for another 100 ps

## LJP
- For testing BB model, try fixing only the semi-axis lengths first, then fix none

### PINN
- For running the PINN, trying to fix problem with running out of disk space → zip files and download, then reupload
- Actually scratch should have 20TB of storage so I might have been in home earlier ;-;
	- There’s already a conda environment with pytorch bruh 🤦‍♀️
- Did some bug-fixing using the debug node, also realized a handy trick to see approx. when your queue will start running: `squeue -u eswong --start`

### Poster Board
- Worked on and finished poster board
	- Regenerated graph

### Verifying Dataset
- Need error bars, confidence intervals for the orientational case → currently there is a peak but it’s supposed to be a straight line (around the z axis rotation)
	- Maybe we can draw a straight line that goes through all the error bars
- I reran my code for rotating around axes using instead of (0.5, 0.5, 2), (1, 1, 0.4) with 30,000 points to see if I can reproduce Dylan’s results
	- It looks pretty symmetric, but very far from a straight line, which is bad

## Optic Glomeruli
- Basically wrote the function to load the input data and corresponding labels but because I didn’t downsample LoomingSpot properly, I’m gonna have to regenerate the data (which won’t take that long but is annoying)
- Just realized I deleted regenerated files arghhhh (and I called them “useless” 😭)
- Regenerated for:
	- FlickeringPatch
	- ExpandingMovingSpot
	- DriftingSquareGrating
	- LoomingSpot
