# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-22]]
I kinda didn’t do much yesterday, Sunday or Saturday as a transition period from California back to New York, but I got some stuff done today.
## LJP
- Meeting with Giorgos: next steps
	- Scaling by U/Umin of side-side case for all cases
	- Plot each calculation (not average) for the 200,000 particles (generating reference values)
- I was able to get the scaling by minimum done for with bounds scaling:

	- Looks pretty similar to the one in the paper
- Running the other cases without bounds scaling now
	- Moved it to seawulf too so I consolidated them into a python script
	- Got it: for without, well depths don’t match up exactly, which might be a problem
