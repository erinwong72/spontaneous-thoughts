# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-14]]
## Optic glomeruli
### Meeting with Ben Cowley
- Instead of using tensorflow, use keras instead:
	- model.train_on_batch()
	- img_history: (width,height,time,num_samples)
	- Or list of past images
- Perhaps LSTM isn’t the best because it isn’t very interpretable
- Route to take:
	- Convolution in space and time (3D convolution)
- Refer to google doc for backbone (not sure if works) of model
- Batch norm before relu for activating non-linearities so gradient + values don’t blow up
- Use train_on_batch vs fit
	- Want to feed in batch iteratively—full control over training data
- #todo/action
	- [x] Re-make “fake” glomeruli responses
		- Simulated frames: 8x8 pixel patch and past 10 frames
	- Bc input will rely on past 10 frames as history
	- [ ] Get deep NN working (at least the code runs)
	- [ ] Make another diagram (input/output, # of filters)
		- [ ] Plot weight matrices (shape/# of parameters)
	- [ ] Compare y_hat and y_test on matplotlib
	- John is working on connectome
