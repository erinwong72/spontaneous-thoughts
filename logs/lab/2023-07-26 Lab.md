# Lab Scratchpad for July 26, 2023.
## Fibrinogen
- Realized that I prepared the central E domain for the wrong force field (opslaa instead of **charmm36**)
	- [[Loading External Force Field to GROMACS]]
	- [[charmm36 mdp parameters]]
	- Followed the rest of the usual preparation steps
		- Got an error of "LINCS WARNING" -> something's wrong with my .mdp file:
			- Didn't set integrator -> set "integrator = steep"
			- Different error now: ^faf550
				- Energy minimization reached the maximum number of steps before the forces reached the requested precision Fmax < 10.
				  writing lowest energy coordinates.
				  Steepest Descents did not converge to Fmax < 10 in 1 steps.

## LJP
- Worked on presentation (progress) for Friday
