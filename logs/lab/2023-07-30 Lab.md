# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-07-30]]
## Fibrinogen
### Server Problems
- Karin replied to my email, saying that this was the fix to the GROMACS problem (can't import library liboomp)
	- Add a path to the executable to the `.bash_profile`
	- Tried adding `PATH="/gpfs/software/gromacs/aocc4.0/openmpi/milan/2022.2/bin/gmx:$PATH"` to the `.bash_profile` and adding `source /gpfs/software/gromacs/aocc4.0/openmpi/milan/2022.2/bin/GMXRC` to `.bashrc`
		- Still giving errors :( 
		- Emailed Karin about the problems again

### Solvated $C_e$ Domain
- NVT equilibration was able to finish overnight → tried NPT equilibration:
	- Confirmed the temperature progression using energy: shows a blank graph on xmgrace, but I’m just going to go ahead with pressure equilibration 💀 (if it errors, it’s probably because of this)
	- Added to [[Writing an equilibration config file]] the NPT specific flags

### PLA + $C_e$ Domain
- Used VMD to measure the dimensions of the PLA molecule:
	- First use a ruler to get some general feel for the magnitude and unit to use (here, angstroms)
	- Mouse → Label → Bond: click one part, then the other, and a distance should appear along the line that connects the two points

	- y: 32.00 A → 50 A → 5 nm
	- z: 314.48 A → 350 A → 35 nm
	- x: 170.31 A → 200 A → 20 nm
- Again for the $C_e$ domain:
	- Only care about the height: 33.08 A → 50 A → 5 nm
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-30 at 5.16.20 PM.png]]
- ==Box dimensions: x,y,z: 20 nm, 10 nm, 35 nm== → used to set up the box 
- Realized that I didn’t get the “monomer” properly – I got the monomer for PLA, but not the “LIG” that is recognized, it’s actually a whole “row” in the PLA block → remade all files as before
- Added Friday’s and today’s notes regarding the PLA + $C_e$ domain to a more reference-able technical note: [[Setting up ligand-polymer interaction]] 
- Ran NVT equilibration on the PLA in the box, changing slightly the nvt.mdp file used for the domain alone (298 K instead of 300 K)
	- Got this fatal error: `Fatal error: number of coordinates in coordinate file (pla_box.gro, 85599) does not match topology (pla.top, 85600)`
		- I think it’s because I did the AddH function on the pla “monomer” but not on the whole molecule 🙄
		- Ok now that added an *extra* hydrogen 

## Optic Glomeruli
- Created new conda environment for experiments in the home server
	- Trying to move everything over there
	- Packages:
		- flystim
		- flyrpc
		- glom_po
		- matplotlib
		- scipy
		- scikit-learn
		- tensorflow (with gpu), according to [Install TensorFlow with pip](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux)
	- Use this bash script to get rid of numa node warnings when using tensorflow
		- Also should probably add to crontab (`sudo crontab -e`)
```bash
echo 0 | tee -a "/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/numa_node"
```
