# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-04]]
## LJP
### PINN Model
- Trying out sine activation function
	- Also really slow
	- ![[Pasted image 20230804100336.png|400]]
- No need to use L-BFGS with ReduceLRPlateau because it‚Äôs already built in
	- Trying L-BFGS without mini-batches first
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 10.56.47 AM.png|225]]
			- Seems like it gets stuck in the local minima (4.6473) for a while, let me see if upping the momentum to 0.9 will help
				- Upping momentum and lower learning rate to 0.0005
				- Implementing L-BFGS ‚Üí need to define parameter method that concatenates epsilon and sigma together
					- It works! Minimum loss was 0.000396
						- ![[Pasted image 20230804152006.png|425]]
					- Now, need to validate, using 2500 cases and 30000 points
						- Implemented save and load model functions

### Meeting with Giorgos and LJP group
  - #todo/action
	  - [x] Verify existing ground truth by sampling a few points and recalculating the potential to see if it matches
	  - [x] Check black box model to see if it can learn a ‚Äúpotential function‚Äù from the data generated in the first 3 cases

### Recalculating LJP to Validate Existing Dataset
- I‚Äôm going to randomly choose 1000 points from the dataset and re-run the code to see if the generated LJP values are the same, documenting the difference as the ‚Äúloss‚Äù, which should ideally be 0.
	- Hmmm‚Ä¶ LJP values don‚Äôt line up exactly ‚Üí messaged Giorgos about it

## Date Palm Image Analysis
- Added in functionality to save the labels and centers that I clustered the pixels together, so it could be compared with true white/black/other colors
	- Instead of segmenting over every pixel, I segmented over the entire matched portion over the image ‚Üí so much faster! üíÄ
- Meeting with Dr. Flowers:
	- Visualize numpy array of matched pixels to see if we can recognize the boundaries 
	- Use the match template function multiple times for different colors
	- Compare number of pixels in boundary than in a square
