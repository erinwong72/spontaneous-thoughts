## LJP
I generated values for all values of number of points between 1000 and 5000 in 250 intervals.
- To make evenly spaced by 250 each time, used `np.linspace(1000, 5000, 17, dtype=int)` (17 is the number of values generated)

Implemented binary search algorithm to find the optimal sigma, allowing specification of tolerance (how close to the actual answer you need to be):
- After calculating the LJP using the coded function, compare with average LJP value
- Depending on whether a larger sigma corresponds with higher LJP, adjust the sigma to be higher or lower by taking the lower bound or the upper bound
- Next step: figure out whether increase in sigma corresponds with higher or lower LJP (should be higher, but need to make sure)
- Based on results here: [Site Unreachable](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/e6aaa4d2-4c33-4afa-ab8c-dcb5f42d8b16?s=u)
