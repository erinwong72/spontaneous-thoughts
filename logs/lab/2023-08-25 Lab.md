# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-25]]
## LJP
- I started an extended-96core run to generate the reference values (can’t believe it’s taking this long)
- Finished up case 3 of reploting the cases with the exact values used in the paper and comparing the graphs (without scaling)
- Found an app that can potentially extract the values from an image of a plot: [PlotDigitizer Online App](https://plotdigitizer.com/app)
	- When I downloaded the csv file, I ran into an error with indexing columns…turns out you can’t have any white space trailing or before
	- Good enough for the first case:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230825112621.png|375]] 
	- There’s a lot going on in the graph with all of them put together:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230825113301.png|375]]
			- For one, the intercenter distances are way off because of the different semi-axis lengths that were used
	- With the real lengths:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230825113934.png|400]]
			- Still not matching completely, but maybe I’m interpreting the lengths wrong?
			- The smallest semi-axis length should, in theory, be around 0.25 so that the vertical asymptote is around 0.5, but that isn’t the case
### Meeting with Prof. Deng and Giorgos
- Insert more points in between high and low (for first graph), lacking points closer to 1
- In real time translate intercenter distance to be actually the distance between edges of the ellipsoids (subtract )
- Prof. Deng’s project overview (2 action items, 2 papers can come out of it)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 12.29.05 PM.png|375]]
	- In the end, using $r_D$: **intercenter distance** (or R_deng) instead of distance of closest approach

## GenAI for DD Meeting
- eIF4E: open hand → closed hand when m7GTP binds
	- Want to avoid this: associated with cancer development — want to prevent interaction
	- Already had ligand that is competitor for m7GTP in the same location → failed because interaction between eIF4E and m7GTP is too strong
	- Dr. Aktas (Harvard prof) suggested to approach differently: *restrain* residues that undergoes structural changes to stabilize m7GTP
		- E103
		- W102
		- W56
		- Move from outside to inside to wrap around m7GTP
- Right now, simulating eIF4E, m7GTP, and eIF4G to understand more about local structure
	- Different chains
	- 3 different structures to see differences
	- Simulating eIF4E, m7GTP and eIF4G all together bc those all complex together in the body
		- m7GTP and eIF4G bind to opposite sites and both cause structural change → want to get the whole picture
	- But want to eventually simulate whole complex with eIF4A and 4E binding protein (suppresses translation?)
- Parts to get involved in:
	1. Find pockets
	2. Find compounds (docking)
	3. All atomic MD

## Date Palm Image Analysis
- Applying edge detection again to the smaller box: I first have to extract the pixels from the selected contour
	1. Find contours (already done)
	2. Create a **mask** for the matched area (kinda like image segmentation)
		1. Blank image as mask
		2. Draw contours on the mask
	3. Create a new image
	4. Apply mask to original image, saving it as the new image using `cv2.bitwise_and`
	- Made a slight change to the get_contours function so that it can handle more variability (like if you just want to see what the contours are and aren’t sure about the ROIs yet)
		- Ok so turns out, within the actual color square no more contours can be identified → a bit of a problem

			- Playing around with the blurring and edge-detection
				- Found an alternative to canny edge detection: [python - Improving Canny Edge Detection - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61643039/improving-canny-edge-detection)
				- Viewing the results of each step
					- Last step (edges)

- A paper that could be promising, specifically for color edge detection: [1406.5549.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5549.pdf) (source code available)
	- Original implementation (in matlab): [GitHub - pdollar/edges: Structured Edge Detection Toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/edges.git)
		- For reference maybe, but I don’t even know matlab so probably not
	- Implementation 1 (without sharpening): [Edge Detection using Structured Forests with OpenCV](https://debuggercafe.com/edge-detection-using-structured-forests-with-opencv/)
	- Random forests can detect the edges of each square pretty well (this is without sharpening):
