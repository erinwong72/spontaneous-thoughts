## Optic Glomeruli
### Debugging Data Generation files
- Yesterday I ran the python script for generating .mp4 files from the .npy ones and realized that when I indicated grayscale, the 1.5 seconds of pre-stimulus time was black instead of gray
	- This was by putting `cmap='gray'` everywhere plt.imshow was called
- Tried doing `plt.gray()` before doing anything else, but that also didn‚Äôt work ;=;
- After trying to set vmin and vmax equal to 0 and 1, it still didn‚Äôt fix the weird normalization problem
	- Taking a look at the numpy array, saw that most was 128 and uint8 was the dtype, so tried `.astype('uint8')` again ‚Üí ==set vmin=0 and vmax=255==
	- Created new debugging notebook, going to display each frame one at a time
		- Seems like the trick above (min=0, max=255) fixed the problem üòå

### Brainstorming Architectures
- Tried implementing convolutional neural network on MNIST google colab notebook instead of just fully-connected layers
- Asked ChatGPT about possible architectures:
	- 3D CNN
		- Following along with this tutorial: [Video classification with a 3D convolutional neural network ¬†|¬† TensorFlow Core](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/video/video_classification)
	- RNN
	- Spatio-temporal attention
	- 3D ResNet
	- 3D ConvLSTM/GRU

### Meeting with Prof. Cowley
- End goal: use the model to reverse engineering the stimuli that should be shown to the flies to distinguish the LC types from each other
	- Need more specific, less basic stimuli
	- How are the LC types actually different from one another?
	- How many models to identify these patterns?
		- Which stimuli can satisfy all models?
- For now: just predicting 
- #todo/action
	- [x] Draw a diagram with network architecture (for conv network and fully connected)
		- Start with conv3d, then restraint for 2 eyes (anatomical constraints)
		- Input: 3D numpy array (pixel, pixel, time)
		- Output: multiple LCs
			- Time series
		- [x] Write the number of parameters needed for every layer in the diagram
		- [x] Instantiate it
	- [x] Research **==[[Separable convolutions|Separable convolution]] layer (be very familiar!)==**
		- Reduces number of parameters quite a bit
		- [x] Make a network for FASHION-MNIST using the separable conv layers
	- [x] Assemble input (data) into a good format
		- Take videos as Xs, use as labels (sum up areas 8x8 square)
		- [x] Should change over time ‚Üí plot the sum over time
	- [ ] Predict simulated response

### Implementing Separable Convs in Fashion MNIST
- Ran into a problem with tensorflow and gpu:
	- 2023-07-31 21:11:21.462736: W tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/gpu/llvm_gpu_backend/gpu_backend_lib.cc:530] Can't find libdevice directory ${CUDA_DIR}/nvvm/libdevice. This may result in compilation or runtime failures, if the program we try to run uses routines from libdevice.
		- Solved: when using conda, have to make sure you‚Äôre searching in the $CONDA_PREFIX directory
		- ```bash
		  conda install -c nvidia cuda-nvcc=11.3.58
		  # Configure the XLA cuda directory
		  mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
		  printf 'export XLA_FLAGS=--xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/\n' >> $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh 
		  source $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
		  # Copy libdevice file to the required path
		  mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/nvvm/libdevice
		  cp $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libdevice.10.bc $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/nvvm/libdevice/
		  ```

## LJP
### Meeting with Giorgos:
- For each specific case, fix everything except for the number of particles
	- See if there‚Äôs any asymptotic behavior ‚Üí then can map a function to extrapolate and get the ‚Äúreal‚Äù value at a certain number of particles
- Plot graphs for the random number of points one
- ML methods:
	- ‚ÄúBlack box approach‚Äù: use the code provided
	- PINN implementation 1: use approach in 2016 paper
		- Epsilon and sigma are two different neural networks
		- Put in all possible cases of semi-axis lengths/orientation/center to see if the model can spit out the right potential
		- Ensemble of two models 
- Takeaways:
	- Prioritize # of points right now
		- Do cases 1 and 2
	- Black box approach (try playing around with LJP NN notebook)
		- See if it gives any results
	- PINN: Giorgos is working on PINN backbone

### Testing # of points (case-wise)
- Made a function to test the number of points for each case:
	- Case 1: basically copy-pasted from the original case-testing, but fixed the distance and allowed for input of a list of # of points to test
		- Distance=2.5 (by inspection of the case-testing graph ‚Üí chose where it started plateauing)
		- Number of points list: originally started really small with `[1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 500000]`, but as there was a large jump between 100000 and 500000, Giorgos recommended plotting an extra point (or 2) between those values
			- List ended up being `[5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000, 500000]` ‚Üí takes around 62 mins to run (not too bad!)
			- ![[Pasted image 20230731182801.png|400]]
	- Case 2: same as case 1, just changed the ellipsoids and distance between them
		- Distance=5.5
		- Number of points list: same as case 1
	- Case 3: same as case 1 and 2, changing ellipsoids and distance
		- Distance=4.0
		- Same # of points
