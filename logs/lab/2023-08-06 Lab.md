# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-06]]
Mainly gearing up for the last week of Garcia!!!
## LJP
- Updated presentation with progress so far
- Working on training the PINN on the actual dataset (ljp_dataset.csv)
	- Made sure to clean the dataset of too high and too small LJP values
	- Make sure batch size is divisible by size of the dataset!!!
	- Want to split the large dataset into 80/20 train/test split
		- Just used train_test_split from scikit-learn (makes it so easy)
- Editing abstract
	- Creating flow chart
		- ![[Blank diagram.png]]
			- Took me so long ;-;
