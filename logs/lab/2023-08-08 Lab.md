# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-08]]

Cutting down the abstracts so that everything fits on one page, even with size 9 citations, for both LJP and fibrinogen project. 
## LJP
- Turns out I generated the dataset for the three cases wrong, so I’m trying again
	- Then will test on black box model and PINN (simpler function)
	- Finally generated the right one, now trying to write a converter (old one that Giorgos made doesn’t work b/c I formatted the input for each index differently)
	- I might have to regenerate it yet again because they’re too many extremes in the dataset (>10 and < -1e-15)
	- Trying by dropping just the >10 values first → 267
	- Dropping < -1e-15 → 48, so most cases are too far apart
	- I think the small sample size is the problem → it hovers around 0.65

- I’ve queued up for a100 overnight but nothing has happened—Giorgos recommends trying the login node gpus
	- Why is the server so busy???
	- Forgot to install pytorch
		- [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded → perhaps scratch is overwhelmed, use the following command to sync everything over to the home directory
			```bash
			rsync -avzi --progress --exclude /gpfs/scratch/eswong/fibrinogen_pla_MD/.git /gpfs/scratch/eswong /gpfs/home
			```
		- Nvm this still doesn’t work, just gonna wait it out
	- Might just run on my own computer overnight
- Worked on weekly report for tomorrow

## Fibrinogen
- Dimensions of the new PLA:
	- x: 214.29 A → 22 nm
	- y: 11.57 A → 2 nm
	- z: 56.16 A → 6 nm
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 1.30.08 PM.png|475]]
- Referencing [[2023-07-30 Lab]] for $C_e$ domain height → 5 nm
- Dimensions of box: 
	- ==22 nm, 8 nm, 6 nm==
- Ran energy minimization step first, then nvt, now npt
## Ethics Paper
- Finished human bias and part of confirmation bias

## Optic Glomeruli
- Maybe there’s a way to get the same number of timepoints using pre-render because then you can specify the timepoints that you want to be in your saved movie → so if I just select the number of frames that corresponds to 6.5 seconds, then I’ll have fixed the problem
	- Sometimes it still generates less than that number of frames — is it because I have them in succession?
- Would using the new package, stimpack, have more functionality?
- Nope, the problem was because they were in succession—some systematic error happens, so I’ll just play them separately!
	- Still some randomness going on → probably has to do with sleep function now
	- It’s all too tedious for me so I’m going to try implementing one that depends on the number of frames instead of time

### Pseudodata
- Generating the 8x8 box from the stimuli:
