# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-18]]
## LJP
### Team Meeting
- Quick paper
	- MAPE vs number of particles with r and shape
		- Different curves/equations for each r and shape → manifold
		- Depends on r and shape (are variables in the equation
		- Asymptote is error
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-18 at 8.14.49 AM.png|350]]
	- Think of possible techniques to “guess” how many particles were used to do Oliver’s calculation
		- Varying number of points, fix everything else → get error bars on the mean and see if you can draw a straight line through the error bars → that will be ground truth
		- Also will get LJP value approaching infinity → ground truth value

		- N1 and N2, consider cases when they are equal, unequal, etc. → extreme cases
			- N1 + N2 = N

		- Find critical point $N_c$, relationship with shape and distance
- Problem with current code
	- Normalization involves using the “bounds” → taking distance vector
		- But, after rotating ellipsoid, some value might be 0 in the distance vector → zeroes out the potential completely
