# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-09-24]]
So… I haven’t really done much in a hot minute, but I did meet with Dr. Flowers on Friday and we decided to push forward with implementing the random forest machine learning model to try to detect the edges better (the one I found in [[2023-08-25 Lab#Date Palm Image Analysis]]).

## Date Palm Image Analysis
- [ ] Read structured forest model paper
- [ ] Implement python code
- [ ] Test on one sample image of the color scale

- Started reading the paper: [[Structured Forests for Edge Detection]]
	- Learned more about [[Decision Trees]]
