# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-09-24]]
So… I haven’t really done much in a hot minute, but I did meet with Dr. Flowers on Friday and we decided to push forward with implementing the random forest machine learning model to try to detect the edges better (the one I found in [[2023-08-25 Lab#Date Palm Image Analysis]]).

## Date Palm Image Analysis
- [ ] Read structured forest model paper
- [ ] Implement python code
- [ ] Test on one sample image of the color scale

- Started reading the paper: [[Structured Forests for Edge Detection]]
	- Learned more about [[Decision Trees]]

## LJP Ellipsoids
Next steps for the project (Based off theoretical findings from Giorgos):
- [ ] Generate reference values for 5,000 particles, ε=σ=1
	- For future reference: epsilon and sigma are **default** set to 1
	- 200,000 might be overkill for a “small” ellipsoid → maybe that’s why results don’t look like how we expect them to?
- [ ] More simulations with smaller N (5,10,20,50,100,500,1000,1500)
- [ ] Fit the correct ε and σ so that the average potential value at e.g. N=10 matches the average value at N=2,000. 
- [ ] Estimate the error for each N level. That error is more like the error bar of that level, a number related to the variance.

- Had to set up seawulf stuff again because it was deleted (smh)

## LC Responses
I tried to split the dataset into train, val, test (0.8, 0.1, 0.1):
- Using `tf.keras.utils.split_dataset(dataset, left_size, right_size, shuffle)`
	- Split twice to get three smaller datasets
- I want to evaluate performance on val dataset after each epoch so that I can leverage early stopping
