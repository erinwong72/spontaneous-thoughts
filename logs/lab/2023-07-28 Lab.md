# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-07-28]]
## Fibrinogen
- Continued trying to generate topology for PLA
	- Isolated one monomer of PLA, saved it as .pdb and .mol2
	- When trying to upload to the CGenFF to turn into an additional topology file, get the following error: `Now processing molecule pla.pdb ...attype warning: hypervalent carbon (valence=5) not supported;skipped molecule. ......`
		- Apparently one of the carbons connected to the oxygens has two double bonds (for the oxygens) and one single bond -> 5 bonds?
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-28 at 1.13.22 PM.png|300]]
		- Edit mol2 file to account for this, based on PLA's actual structure
			- ![[Pasted image 20230728131703.png|200]]
				- One of the oxygens should be connected via a single bond
	- After adjusting .mol2 file, get the error: `attype warning: carbon radical, carbocation or carbanion not supported;skipped molecule. ......`
		- Maybe one of the single bonds needs to be a double bond so carbon can fulfill its valence shell
		- Nope, just needed an extra hydrogen -> use the `addH` function under the tools dropdown menu
	- When running the charmm2gmx python file:
		- Go to networkx's (follow the error) call of functions.gcd and replace with `from math import gcd`
		- Make sure NetworkX=2.3, Numpy=1.20
