# Lab Scratchpad for [[2023-08-15]]
## LJP
- Giorgos found a bug in my L-BFGS implementation—I’m not updating sigma0 after loss becomes < 1, I just recall the previous value each time → I fixed it
- Made a github repository and figured out how to navigate the different branches: [[Github branch navigation]]

## GenAI4DD
### Meeting (recap of progress) with Team
- Trying to do all-atomic MD simulation for eIF4E and m7GTP and characterize local changes due to interaction:
	- Structures: 2gpq, 4tpw, AF0P0670 (alpha fold structure)
- Different methods of simulation:
	1. Place proteins in random positions in a box and solvate/neutralize
	2. Place m7GTP at ideal binding location
	3. Perform docking analysis and rank docking site (most likely binding site for MD solution)
