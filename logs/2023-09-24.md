# Thoughts for the day...

> [!note] Morning thoughts.
> I feel a lot better since last week (when I last logged in obsidian). Last time I wrote, exactly one week ago, I was still recovering from covid. Today, Iâ€™m pretty much all recovered, and I feel great -- I even went on a 6 mile run with the girls this morning (Izzy and Emily, it was raining though). Iâ€™m going to start up my lab notebooks again and get back to my projects. Itâ€™s a long weekend, so I should try to at least be somewhat productive ðŸ˜‰.
