## LC Responses
B/c of the hassle and issues yesterday, I caved and bought more LFS packs to get repo storage up to 200 GB. LFS still uploads really slow, so I think I have to finish that when I get home.

Workaround for now: uploading new (undownsampled) stimuli as a zip file.

The preprocessing script from yesterday seems to be working well, next up is finding how to crop for only the left optic lobe FOV:

Ben says:
>if so, that's not a problem, we can just crop assuming the entire width is 360 visual degrees of the male's visual field
if it's the left optic lobe, we would take 130 degrees to the left from center up to 30 degrees to the right from center (the optic lobe's visual degrees is ~160 degrees)...the fly cannot see entirely behind her, but her left optic lobe does see a portion of the right visual field”

Videos are 1280 in width (just dealing with width for now):
- Each degree ~3.55555555556 pixels
- center is 640
- 130 degrees = 462.2222 pixels
- 30 degrees = 106.66667
- Index: [178, 747]

Slight problem: the DriftingGrating and MovingSpotOnDriftingGrating stimuli don’t have mean gray background before and after the stimuli
