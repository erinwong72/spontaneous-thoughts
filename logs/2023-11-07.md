# Thoughts for the day...
I got a 93 on my physics test 😭, probably because of the last parallel plates problem. I feel like such a failure because I actually studied really hard for it, but how am I so stupid ahhhh 🤦‍♀️, I figured it out easily after but second-guessed myself during the test. Because of that my average dropped by one whole point to a 96.
## LC Responses
I fixed all the stimuli problems:
- Compiled them all into one numpy file with shape (2250, 30, 30, 10) since we’re now taking seconds (1,6) instead of (1,5)
- Renamed them to match stimuli names
- Ensured the order of the stimuli in the large numpy file (processed_X_data.npy) was correct
- Sanity-checked with the generated videos, comparing with previous (distorted) stimuli
- Uploaded to the [shared google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QCppin68UBNTbf_P0y6zO3dgkQ3M8YLZ)

## PINN for LJP
Finally figured out what has been going on with the PINN:
- I had a bit of a hard time getting the PINN to train because (I didn’t know this then) the learning rate was too low -> infinite loss as early as the first batch.
- Training seems to be the best when the learning rate is around 1e-2 for both epsilon and sigma and sigma0

Actually, it seems to be either an input data scaling or
