# Template Modeling score

Aka TM-score, a marker of protein structure similarity. It ranges from 0 to 1 with scores < 0.20 being unrelated and > 0.50 to be roughly the same fold.

Although [[Root mean square deviation]] is more often used, it is more accurate at comparing full-chain/length structures, specifically.
