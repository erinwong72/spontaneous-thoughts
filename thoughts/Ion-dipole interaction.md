Ion-dipole interaction
$$E \propto -\frac{|z|\mu}{r^2}$$
- $z$ = charge of ion
- $\mu$ = dipole moment

Like all other intermolecular forces to follow, this makes sense as it’s a modified form of the coulombic potential, with two key differences:
1. Negative sign denotes that interaction lowers the energy → favorable (think about solvation of an ion in water)
2. Dependent on $r^2$ instead of just $r$ → interaction acts over a shorter distance because:
	1. There is a dipole instead of another ion
	2. The ion is repelled by the other partial charge until at very far distances, the ion is almost *equidistant* from both and any interaction just cancels out and “falls off”
