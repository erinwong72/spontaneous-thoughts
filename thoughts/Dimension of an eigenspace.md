# Dimension of an eigenspace

Take the standard approach of calculating $S_{\lambda}$:
$$dim(S_{\lambda}) = n-r(A-\lambda I)$$
- dimension of the matrix representation - rank = # of zero rows

Explanation:
Once you have the eigenvalue, you usually compute $(A-\lambda I)x = 0$ and then count up the number of basis vectors needed to represent those solutions (linear combination) → dimension.

But the # of basis vectors depends on the number of free variables → the zero rows in the row-reduced form of the matrix = dim of original matrix - rank.
