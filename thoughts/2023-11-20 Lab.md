## Lennard-Jones Potential
I finally got results for the fixed structure run:

- Why didn’t it work 😭
- Very disappointing results, running it with fixed structure was supposed to thin the thickness of the LJP plot (less variability)

Figured it out: I was still generating new structures every time a random case was called, so the structure was indeed not fixed.
- We wanted to fix structures across **all** cases, but I only fixed it for each pair of ellipsoids

> 1. Generate the “reference” ellipsoid outside the main code for each processor
> 2. **Broadcast** this ellipsoid (the collection of points) to all processors so that everything truly is fixed
