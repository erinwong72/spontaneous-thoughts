# Eigenbasis
Given a transformation T:V → V is a [[Linear Transformations]], and dim(V) =n:
![[Pasted image 20231128191246.png]] is an eigenbasis of V.
- If dim(E) < n, an eigenbasis doesn’t exist

Matrix representation of  in an eigenbasis is very simple:
- Diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on the diagonal
