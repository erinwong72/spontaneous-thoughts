# Eigenbasis
Given a transformation T:V → V is a [[Linear Transformations]], and dim(V) =n:
![[Pasted image 20231128191246.png]] is an eigenbasis of V.
- If $dim(E) < n$, an eigenbasis doesn’t exist 
	- Used in the criterion for [[Diagonalizable matrices]]

Matrix representation of a transformation in an eigenbasis is very simple:
- Diagonal matrix with **eigenvalues** on the diagonal

→ Representation in the standard basis involves the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues along the diagonal:
- Use standard method of switching between bases

$$A_S^S=MDM^{-1}$$
- M is a **modal matrix**: representations of eigenbasis vectors as the columns
