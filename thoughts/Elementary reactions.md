# Elementary reactions
They are classified based on their **molecularity**: number of particles needed to collide to produce the reaction, but ==different== from **order** of a reaction.
- Uni and bimolecular elementary reactions being the most common.

Individual rate laws for each elementary step are produced from the molecularity of each element directly translating to order.

>[!HINT] Rate limiting/determining step
>The slowest elementary reaction in the reaction mechanism is the rate-limiting step of the reaction, forming a **bottleneck** into the process of forming the product. All other steps after this *donâ€™t matter* to the overall rate law.
