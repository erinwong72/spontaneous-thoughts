# Elementary reactions
They are classified based on their **molecularity**, with uni and bimolecular elementary reactions being the most common.

Just like any typical reaction, they are accompanied by reverse reactions to create a dynamic equilibrium in the reaction mechanism.

## Constructing [[Rate Laws]]

Simplifications for constructing a rate law:
>[!idea] Steady state approximation
>Intermediates of elementary reactions remain at a constant concentration, so the *net* rate of formation is 0.
- Because they are thought to react as soon as it’s formed

>[!idea] Pre-equilibrium condition
> This states that that the rate of consumption of the intermediate is negligible compared to the rates of formation and decomposition
> 
- So you can get the rate of formation of the intermediate from the elementary reaction its *directly* produced from instead of calculating its net rate, etc.

>[!HINT] Rate limiting/determining step
>The slowest elementary reaction in the reaction mechanism is the rate-limiting step of the reaction, forming a **bottleneck** into the process of forming the product. All other steps after this *don’t matter* to the overall rate law.

Steps:
1. Write out a possible reaction mechanism
2. Write the rate law based on any elementary reaction that produces the overall products
3. Look for any intermediates and derive rate laws for those (rate of *formation*/*decomposition*, depending on the possible reaction mechanism) based on the other elementary reactions
4. Substitute back in to the overall rate law and solve
