# Dipole-dipole interaction
$$E \propto -\frac{\mu_1\mu_2}{r^3}$$

Main differences:
1. No brainer: Replacing ion charges with dipole moments
2. $r^3$ dependent, as now you have *both* molecules (dipoles on both) being “canceled out” instead of none for regular ions and 1 set of partial charges for **ion-dipole interaction**

**Hydrogen bonding** is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction (which is already the strongest one not involving ions). What makes it so special (and so strong) is hydrogen’s teeny **size**—when bound to an extremely electronegative atom, it becomes partially positive and can easily slip in/move very close to another electronegative atom on a different molecule. You can think of it making the most out of the limited interaction due to $r^3$ restriction.
## Rotating dipole-dipole interaction
$$E \propto -\frac{\mu_1\mu_2}{r^6}$$
The only difference between this and regular dipole-dipole interaction is that this occurs in polar molecules that are moving around/rotating, like in a gas or liquid. Because of such rotation, it’s even more likely that the molecules are *not favorably (energetics-wise) oriented,* thus leading to very weak interactions. This rotation also explains quite a few things:
1. Why the molecules must be so close together in order to interact—closer means more likely for one dipole to be oriented the “right” way.
2. Why the **Kinetic Molecular Theory** is actually really good for gases: gases are spinning and moving so fast that most interactions won’t be favorable and are very weak
3. How liquids are different from gases and why there is a “hump” to get over to become a gas: liquid molecules are much closer together, move less fast, thus giving some strength to the rotating dipole-dipole interactions
