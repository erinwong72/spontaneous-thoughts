# Inelastic collisions
Usually see some sort of frictional force (or nonconservative force) slowing one object down to *match the velocity* of another object in the system:
- Two blocks sticking to each other
- Ball rolling over an edge (ball has to match edge)
- Sand landing on conveyor belt (sand matches conveyor)

>[!tip]
>There will be an equation of constraint where the two objects will have to move together after the collision.
