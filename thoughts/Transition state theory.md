# Transition state theory

A more improved version of [[Collision theory for chemical reactions]], additionally accounting for reactions in solution with larger **steric requirements** than those in the gaseous phase.

>[!info] Main idea
>Interacting particles form **activated complexes**, a transition state of higher potential energy than the products and the reactants.

The collision is more the *meeting* and *distortion* of particles through the solvent as they move through. When the particles meet with enough kinetic energy (due to a “kick” from solvent molecules), instead of immediately breaking apart, they form an **activated complex**.

**Potential energy surfaces** of the energy changes of the location of atoms during a reaction help with determining reaction mechanisms -- you can tell the lowest-energy path through it and what it requires, structurally.
