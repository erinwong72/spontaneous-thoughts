# Work and Energy
Work is the amount of energy transferred from one system to the other.
$$W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{r}$$
Simple example from Kinematics:

$\theta$ is the angle between F & d (three situations):

# Electric fields
Pay attention to the agent that is doing work and in what direction it is in.

## What if force varies?
$$ 
W=\int\vec F \cdot d\vec r \\
$$
Applying the integral to a problem:

## Work-Energy Theorem, with integral
$$\begin{align}
W_{net}=\int F_{net} \ dx \\
W_{net}=\int ma \ dx \\
W_{net}=\int m \frac{dv}{dt} \ dx \\
W_{net}=\int_{v_i}^{v_f} mv \ dv \\
W_{net}= \frac{1}{2}mv^2=\Delta KE
\end{align}$$
Where is the potential energy?
- Can’t you also do work with potential energy?
## Potential Energy
Just the energy of position or *configuration*

**Conservative forces**: same amount of work independent of path
![[Drawing 2023-11-09 10.33.19.excalidraw]]

So potential energy is only defined for conservative forces.
- Conservative forces don’t *transfer* energy out of/into system, but it **transforms** it
	- Gravity takes away kinetic energy from the system, transforming it into potential energy

$$\begin{align}
W_c=-\Delta U_c \\
U=-\int \vec F \cdot \vec dr
\end{align}
$$

Getting potential energy as a *function of position*, instead of a change in potential energy:

 $U_g$: gravitational potential energy
$$U_g=mgh$$
- h is relative to a *known* reference point
- Force of gravity is a **conservative** force

Example: finding potential energy function for Hooke’ law

Can do something similar with Coulomb’s law:
