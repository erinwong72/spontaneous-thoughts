# Makings of the Constitution
**Alexander Hamilton** and **James Madison** raised concerns about the need for a stronger national government → **Annapolis convention**, which was a sad convention (only 5 states had delegates)

**Shay’s Rebellion** raised flags, prompting more states to send delegates (all but Rhode Island) to the next convention in Pennsylvania.

## Constitutional Convention
They all agreed on:
1. Need for a stronger, centralized government 
2. Need a majority vote, not unanimity
3. Dividing government into three branches

Didn’t agree on ==how states would be represented==:
- **Virginia Plan**: favored large states, both houses of the Legislative branch would have representation based on population
- **New Jersey Plan**: favored small states, one house in the legislative branch, equal representation no matter how large of a state it is
- Grand committee with one delegate per state was tasked to solve this:
	- **Great Compromise**: bicameral legislature, lower house (House of Reps) based on population, upper (Senate) had two members no matter what 
	- **Three-fifths compromise**: ⅗ of slaves would be counted as one person in the population of a state
