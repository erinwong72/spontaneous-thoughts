# Elastic collisions
Momentum and energy are both conserved.

Using conservation of energy, you can reduce a complex equation to:
$$v_{1i}-v_{2i} = v_{2f}-v_{1f}$$

>If you shift into the **[[center of mass]] frame of reference**, two balls colliding in an elastic collision will have 0 momentum, so they will rebound with the same initial speeds, but possibly at some angle (along the same line).
