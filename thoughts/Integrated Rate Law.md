# Integrated Rate Laws

>[!idea]
>Expresses the relationship between the *instantaneous* concentration of reactant and the initial concentration, using the rate.

## Second Order
To derive, remember that:
$$Rate = \frac{-d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^{2}$$

>[!example] Equation
>$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{[A]_t}-\frac{1}{[A]_{0}} = kt \\
\therefore \frac{1}{[A]_{t}}=\frac{1}{[A]_{0}}+kt
\end{align}$$
