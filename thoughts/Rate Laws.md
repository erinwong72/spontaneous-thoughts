# Rate Laws

The **unique average rate** of a reaction is the same no matter which reactant/product you consider -- they are all scaled down by their coefficients.
$$- \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{dA}{dt}= - \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}= \frac{1}{c} \cdot \frac{dC}{dt}= \frac{1}{d} \cdot \frac{dd}{dt}$$
- If you know the rate of consumption/production of one species, you can figure out the rest based on the chemical reaction


So how do we actually find the rate law for a general chemical reaction?
â†’ by breaking it down into its building blocks, [[Elementary reactions]]

A less applicable way could be to consider the ratios of the forward reaction to the reverse reaction for every **elementary reaction**, as:
$$K = \frac{k_1}{k_{1'}} \cdot \frac{k_2}{k_{2'}}\cdot ...$$
- Could be useful for elementary reactions with fewer steps
