# Rate Laws
So how do we actually find the rate law for a general chemical reaction?
â†’ by breaking it down into its building blocks, [[Elementary reactions]]

A less applicable way could be to consider the ratios of the forward reaction to the reverse reaction for every elementary reaction, as:
$$K = \frac{k_1}{k_{1'}} \cdot \frac{k_2}{k_{2'}}\cdot ...$$
- Could be useful for elementary reactions with fewer steps
