# Anti-slavery movement
Originally, by the 1780s, slavery looked like it was on its way out:
1. 1780s: Northern states started to end slavery
2. 1787: Slavery banned in Northwest Territory

But then:
1. 1793: Cotton gin revived slavery → made cotton production more profitable
2. Slave population x4 from 1800→1860 despite prohibition in 1808

Southerners defended slavery *morally*, as a reaction to abolitionism (to defend themselves too) and dependence on cotton as a profitable crop.

## Slave Trends in the North and South
Why was the actual end of slavery in the North so much later than the legal end?
The **grandfather clause** in the legislation protected the slaveholders — they could hold on to any slaves they had but they couldn’t purchase any new slaves or keep any children.

In the South, slave populations shifted from the Upper South (growing tobacco) to the Deep South (the “Cotton Kingdom”).

## Forms of Resistance to Slavery
Two schools of thought:
1. [[Gradualism]]
2. [[Immediatism (Abolitionism)]]

In politics, most anti-slavery movements tried to stop slavery from spreading into western territories through legislation:
	1. **Free Soil Party**: wanted to prohibit slavery in western territories and receive free lands in the west to settle in
	2. Republican Party: Whigs + Free Soil Party
