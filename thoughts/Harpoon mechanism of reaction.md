# Harpoon mechanism of reaction
The mechanism of reaction that works over long distances and does not require a collision.

>Electron transfer over long distances to form ions that then attract.

1. An electron from the species with low ionization energy acts as the harpoon, landing on the electronegative species
2. The harpoon electron “reels it in” to the donor species
3. The resulting product then moves in the same direction the donor species was moving in.

Notable example: $K$ and $I_2$
