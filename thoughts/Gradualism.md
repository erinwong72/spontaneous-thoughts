# Gradualism
They believed in:
1. Gradual Emancipation
2. Compensation of slaveholders

However, they were racist (believed slavery was morally wrong, but didnâ€™t want blacks to live amongst them) so they wanted **ex-patriation**, to send the freed slaves out of the country.
- Founded Liberia, a country in Africa for slaves to be deported to

Examples of gradualists:
- Thomas Jefferson
- James Monroe
- American Colonization Society: purchased freedom of many slaves and sent them to Liberia
