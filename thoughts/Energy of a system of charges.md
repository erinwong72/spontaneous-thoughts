# Energy of a system of charges

1. Regardless of the path that a charge takes to move to a final position $p_f$ that is $r$ away from another charge $q_1$, the work done is the same.
$$\begin{align}
ds = \frac{dr}{\cos \theta} \\
\vec F \cdot ds = |\vec{F}|\frac{dr}{\cos \theta}\cos \theta\\
\therefore\vec F \cdot ds = |\vec{F}| dr
\end{align}$$

==**Electrical potential energy**== of the system is constant regardless of the **order** or configuration that the charges are brought in.
$$U = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k\neq j}\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}(\frac{q_jq_k}{r_{jk}})$$
