# Constructing [[rate laws]]

Rate Laws can be *directly* constructed from [[Elementary reactions]] -- coefficients are exponents.

- So you can get the rate of formation of the intermediate from the elementary reaction its *directly* produced from instead of calculating its net rate, etc.

## Methods for constructing rate laws
1. Equilibrium method:
	1. Steps:
		1. Write out a possible reaction mechanism
		2. Find *slowest*, [[Elementary reactions#^dbee03|rate-determining step]] and write out rate law
		3. Look at intermediates in that step and find an equation for their concentrations
		4. Plug in and solve for overall rate, grouping all the other kâ€™s together
2. [[Steady State Approximation]]
	1. Steps:
