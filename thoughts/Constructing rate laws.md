# Constructing [[rate laws]]

Rate Laws can be *directly* constructed from [[Elementary reactions]] -- coefficients are exponents.

- So you can get the rate of formation of the intermediate from the elementary reaction its *directly* produced from instead of calculating its net rate, etc.

## Methods for constructing rate laws
1. Equilibrium method:
	1. Steps:
		1. Write out a possible reaction mechanism
		2. Find *slowest*, [[Elementary reactions#^dbee03|rate-determining step]] and write out rate law
		3. Look at intermediates in that step and find an equation for their concentrations
		4. Plug in and solve for overall rate, grouping all the other k’s together
2. [[Steady State Approximation]] method:
	1. Steps:
		1. Look for the equations that have the overall product as a product and write the rate law (for the product) using a combination of the equations
		2. Look for intermediates and ==set their overall rates to 0==
		3. Use the equations to find the rate of formation of intermediates and solve for concentration
		4. Plug back in and solve.

>[!tip] 
>Keep an eye out for “hidden” expressions of intermediate rates within the equations for other intermediates → can simplify the math a lot.
