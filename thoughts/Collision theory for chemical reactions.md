# Collision theory for chemical reactions

>[!info] Main idea
>Reactions happen when molecules/particles collides with enough energy > $E_{min}$.

If two molecules donâ€™t collide with enough energy, they simply bounce off each other instead of engaging in the chemical reaction.

The overall equation consists of two parts:
1. **Collision frequency**, based on concentration of molecules, size, speed
	- $$\sigma v_{rel}N_{A}^{2}[A][B]$$
		- $\sigma$ = collision cross-section, the area exposed on a molecule for collision
2. **Activation energy**, dictating that only particles with enough activation energy will lead to reaction
	- The **Boltzmann distribution** is used to calculate the number of molecules that have enough energy
	- $$e^{\frac{-E_{min}}{RT}}$$
3. **Steric factor** accounts for a preference for a certain relative orientation in the reaction
