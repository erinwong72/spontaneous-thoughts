## Date Palm Image Analysis
I found a way to use the detected color palettes to match to a target distribution of colors:
- [Automatic color correction with OpenCV and Python - PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/02/15/automatic-color-correction-with-opencv-and-python/)
- Using histogram matching: [Histogram matching with OpenCV, scikit-image, and Python - PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/02/08/histogram-matching-with-opencv-scikit-image-and-python/)

>[!important] Current goal
>1. Detect color card (will need to input **threshold size**)
>2. Color correct the whole image using histogram matching
>3. Develop web app/native app that can do this

Do I even need machine learning algorithm?
- Don’t have to compare each square, can just compare the color card itself
- Never mind, I do, because I don’t want to have to input the size of the color card every time

New plan (will make it so that it’s all done in python):
1. Use model to extract the color card from each image
2. Use the reference image and extract the color card pixels too (to make the two images as close as possible)
	1. Will need to use a different threshold size -- is there a way to detect this automatically? → provide the person a tool to measure the sides and compute area
3. Compare histograms of each and scale so that the pixel values in the image match that of the reference
