## Date Palm Image Analysis
I found a way to use the detected color palettes to match to a target distribution of colors:
- [Automatic color correction with OpenCV and Python - PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/02/15/automatic-color-correction-with-opencv-and-python/)
- Using histogram matching: [Histogram matching with OpenCV, scikit-image, and Python - PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/02/08/histogram-matching-with-opencv-scikit-image-and-python/)

>[!important] Current goal
>1. Machine learning algorithm for detecting color card
>2. Color correct the whole image using histogram matching
>3. Develop web app/native app that can do this

Do I even need machine learning algorithm?
- Don’t have to compare each square, can just compare the color card itself
