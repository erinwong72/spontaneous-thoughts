## Date Palm Image Analysis
I found a way to use the detected color palettes to match to a target distribution of colors:
- [Automatic color correction with OpenCV and Python - PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/02/15/automatic-color-correction-with-opencv-and-python/)
- Using histogram matching: [Histogram matching with OpenCV, scikit-image, and Python - PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/02/08/histogram-matching-with-opencv-scikit-image-and-python/)

>[!important] Current goal
>1. Detect color card (will need to input **threshold size**)
>2. Color correct the whole image using histogram matching
>3. Develop web app/native app that can do this

Do I even need machine learning algorithm?
- Don’t have to compare each square, can just compare the color card itself
- Never mind, I do, because I don’t want to have to input the size of the color card every time

New plan (will make it so that it’s all done in python):
1. Use model to extract the color card from each image
2. Use the reference image and extract the color card pixels too (to make the two images as close as possible)
	1. Will need to use a different threshold size -- is there a way to detect this automatically? → provide the person a tool to measure the sides and compute area
3. Compare histograms of each and scale so that the pixel values in the image match that of the reference

Possible implementation:
1. Identify the color references in the image. You can do this manually by sampling pixels from the color scale and noting their RGB values.
2. Calculate the color correction matrix to map the color references to their desired values. This can be done using linear algebra techniques such as solving a system of linear equations.
3. Apply the color correction matrix to the image:
```python
corrected_image = cv2.transform(image, color_correction_matrix)
```

Now, `corrected_image` contains the original image with color correction applied, mapping the color references to their desired values. The "true" white in the color scale should be mapped to 255, 255, 255 on the RGB scale.

To generate color correction matrix:
```python
import numpy as np

# Sampled RGB values (old colors)
old_colors = np.array([[old_R1, old_G1, old_B1],
                       [old_R2, old_G2, old_B2],
                       # ... add more rows for each sampled color
                       ])

# Desired RGB values (new colors)
new_colors = np.array([[new_R1, new_G1, new_B1],
                       [new_R2, new_G2, new_B2],
                       # ... add more rows for each desired color
                       ])

# Solve for the color correction matrix
correction_matrix, residuals, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(old_colors, new_colors, rcond=None)

# The correction matrix
print("Color Correction Matrix:")
print(correction_matrix)
```

1. Get mean intensity of each mask’s color for each image → old colors
2. Get same ones for the reference image → new colors
3. Solve color correction matrix
