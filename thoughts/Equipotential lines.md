# Equipotential lines
Similar to **contour lines** on topographic maps: the work done when moving along an equipotential line (or the potential difference) is 0.

 >[!important] Idea
Equipotential lines are always **perpendicular** to electric field lines, since only when you move perpendicular do you do no work.

Work is only done when moving from one equipotential line to the other â€” you can use this to find electric potentials at points along such lines:
