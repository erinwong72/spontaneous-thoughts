# Bank War
## State of the B.U.S.
At the point of the Jackson administration, the national bank (v2 created by Henry Clay) would collect money from state banks and lease out loans → really, the wealthy shareholders were benefiting the most (one of Jackson’s arguments).

State banks issued bank notes based on the amount of specie (gold/silver coin), which was the money that was in circulation. 
- The bank notes were like checks, could be cashed back at banks to exchange for specie, but this practice was rare
- State banks could technically cheat by rolling out more notes than they had specie → whenever the some one cashes in a note, the BUS would withdraw specie from the bank that issued the note

## Grievances
1. Much of the stock (of the bank) was held by wealthy or foreign investors — *exclusive privilege*, like a monopoly 
2. Unconstitutional because it’s not necessary and proper
3. Basically transfers wealth from the poor to the wealthy (taxes from common people → bank → loaned out to common man → interest → profits for investors)

## Actions of Jackson
1. He issues a Bank Veto in 1832 but it’s still “alive” → kills bank by withdrawing government funds → bank *died* by 1836
2. Put government funds into “pet banks” (state-chartered banks)
	- Banks no longer checked → starts cheating again (issue more notes that specie available) → **inflation**
3. Jackson issued “**specie circular**” which made it so that you could only buy land using specie → people had many banknotes and started cashing them in, but the banks didn’t have enough money → ***Panic of 1837***
