# Diagonalizable matrices

$A \sim D$, which is a diagonal matrix, so A is diagonalizable.

Based on:
- A and D have the same eigenvalues
- If D is diagonal, the diagonal values are eigenvalues

## Criterion for diagonalizability
If A has an eigenbasis, then A is diagonalizable and vice versa.
- If all the eigenvalues are **distinct**, then there exists an eigenbasis

What about with repeated eigenvalues, will there still be an eigenbasis?
