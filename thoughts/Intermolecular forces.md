London interaction
$$E \propto -\frac{\alpha_1\alpha_2}{r^6}$$
Main difference lies in the numerator this time, depending on the **polarizability** of the molecule, aka how likely are its electrons to form an instantaneous dipole that starts a “chain” of interactions in neighboring molecules as more dipoles are formed.

The strength depends heavily on distance, so the **size** and **shape** (rod vs sphere) of the molecule makes a huge difference. It also, however, depends on the **orientation** of electrons (whether they are tightly bound to the nucleus or shielded by inner layers).

Dipole-induced-dipole interaction
$$E \propto -\frac{\mu_1^2\alpha_2}{r^6}$$
The main difference is the $\mu^2$, which just shows how the dipole has a greater contribution to the interaction than the induced-dipole.

Van der waals interactions
A general class of interactions that act only over very short distances, with the commonality of having $r^6$ in the denominator of the expression describing its energy.
