# Minimum image convention

Provides a rule/framework to deal with particle interactions in the setting of [[Periodic boundary conditions]]. Because you have to consider particle interactions with the periodic images in the infinitely many copies, the minimum distance between two particles must be carefully calculated (think what if the particles are at opposite edges of the box?).
