# Chain reactions
This is when one highly reactive intermediate (usually a **radical**), called a **chain carrier**, reacts to form another highly reactive intermediate and so onâ€¦

1. Initiation: the chain carrier is formed in an elementary reaction that takes place under **heat** or **light**
2. Propagation: the chain carrier reacts with a reactant to form another carrier
3. Termination: two chain carriers combine to form a stable product

Sometimes, they might end up producing explosions, especially in **chain branching** reactions where *multiple* carriers are produced in one elementary reaction.
