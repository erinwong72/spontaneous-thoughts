# Catalysis

>[!info] Main idea
>Catalysts only provide an alternative, lower-energy path. They donâ€™t alter the equilibrium because they affect both the forward and backwards equilibrium constant the same.

*Homogenous* catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants.

>[!caution]
>When there are two pathways for a reaction, one slower, governed by a [[Elementary reactions#^9594d8|rate determining step (RDS)]], and one faster, sped up by catalysis, the ==faster== one determines the overall reaction rate + rate law.

*Heterogenous* catalysts are in a different phase than the reactants, usually:
1. Finely divided
2. Porous solids
- So surface area can be maximized due to the nature of the catalyzed reaction

Reactants are adsorbed to the surface of the heterogenous catalyst, weakening their bonds and making it easier for products to form (lowering activation energy). Too strong adsorption, however, may lead to *inactivation* of the catalyst.

In industry, **microporous catalysts** are used (type of heterogenous catalyst):
- High specificity with selective structure (**Zeolites** have hexagonal tunnels) that allow for holding the intermediate complex down until it converts into products
- Adsorbs pollutants to convert them into less harmful output (as part of a reaction)
