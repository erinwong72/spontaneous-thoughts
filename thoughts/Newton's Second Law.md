# Newtonâ€™s second law
How is force measured? Obviously using **standard bodies**. Essentially, to calculate the acceleration imparted by a force, compare the mass of the object to that of a standard body, then scale up the known acceleration of the standard (when imparted by that very force)! 

But, it turns out you donâ€™t need standard bodies at all because of the *inversely proportional* relationship between mass and acceleration. After all, comparing two standard bodies is just like comparing two different objects.

In the end, you end up deriving $\vec F = m\vec a$ from $\frac{m_a}{m_b} = \frac{a_b}{a_a}$.

**Standard bodies** are still pretty important though, they define the **newton** ($1 \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}/\text{s}^2$) since the S.I unit weight for a standard body is 1 kg ðŸ¤“!

It might be pretty obvious, but two objects that are stuck together/move together (no sliding away) have the *same* **acceleration**.
