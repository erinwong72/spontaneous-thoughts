My first concrete encounter with programming was when my brother proudly showed me a robot he programmed to perform simple tasks using an Arduino. With a few lines of code, which at that time, looked like a foreign language to me, he was able to get the robot to pick up a ball on the ground, place it in a cannon that was its arm and launch it towards a target. Amazed, I wanted to do the same. As I grew up, my brother continued to show off his creations, introducing me to new languages and the possibilities they provided. At one point, this was unix and the whole Linux operating system, with the many distributions and endless customizability encapsulated within. While I had marveled at all the previous projects he had shown to me, it was with Linux where I took my first steps into the sphere of computer programming.
