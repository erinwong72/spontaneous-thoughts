# The Comparison Test
Compare a series where you don’t know the convergence to one where you **do** know.

>[!idea]
series > divergent = divergent
series < converge = convergent

However, if you show something to be < divergent or > convergent, you can’t do anything useful.

1. If the comparison series is ==divergent==: If every element in the unknown series is *larger* than every element in the comparison, then it also diverges.
2. If the comparison series is ==convergent==: If every element in the unknown series is *smaller* than every element in the comparison, it also converges
