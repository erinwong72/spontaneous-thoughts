# Convergence tests
For all those “quirky” series that are neither harmonic nor geometric 😘.

Most of them will tell you **if** the limit of sequence of partial sums exists, but won’t tell you **what** it converges to.
Except for:
- Geometric series: converges iff $|r|<1$ → to $\frac{a}{{1-r}}$
- Harmonic series diverges
- Taylor-McLauren series

General properties: the following do not change convergence (shown by considering the harmonic series as a “base”)
1. Convergent series + convergent series converges
	1. If it’s a geometric series, you can add up each sum of each sequence to get the overall sum
2. Multiplying by non-zero constant → harmonic-like series (multiplying harmonic series by a constant) always diverge
3. Removing finite number of terms: essentially subtracting a large finite value from infinity → still infinity

So, find the convergence of the “**base sequence**” first and then use the properties.
