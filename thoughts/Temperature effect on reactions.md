# Temperature effect on reactions
Typically, an increase in temperature increases reaction rate as well.

>[!formula] General equation
$$\ln k = \ln A - \frac{E_{a}}{RT}$$

The higher the activation energy, the more temperature-dependent a reaction is.

Reactions that follow this equation exhibit **Arrhenius behavior**.

>[!formula] Comparing rates at different temperatures
$$\ln{\frac{k'}{k}}=\ln A - E_{a}(\frac{1}{{T'}}- \frac{1}{T})$$
- Hmâ€¦ very similar format to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (relating partial pressures)
