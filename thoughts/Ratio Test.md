# Ratio Test
Treat the series as a geometric series and see what happens when you take the limit of the ratio between consecutive terms.

$$L =\lim_{ n \to \infty } \frac{a_{n}}{a_{n-1}}$$
This works because as $n \to \infty$, the series looks more and more like a geometric series, so looking at the limit, you can see whether it converges (treat L like r).

- $|L| < 1$ → series converges
- Equal to 1→ inconclusive
- Otherwise, divergent
