# Electric potential
**Infinite lines of charge** have infinite amounts of potential (infinite charge):
- But they do have potential difference

Why don’t you need to take into account the horizontal orientation? (Only accounting for vertical distance)
Because we’re moving parallel to the line of charge and the potential is $E \cdot dA$, so only the distance matters.

**Infinite sheets** are very similar, and the fact that the electric field is constant perpendicular to the surface of the sheet simplifies the potential.
- If the electric field is constant, the potential changes uniformly between two points (think of the slope relationship, electric field is the gradient)
