# Structured Forests for Edge Detection

>[!summary]
>Predict segmentation masks given small areas, “patches” of the input image, using unsupervised learning to learn more variations in edges (no predefined classes of types of edges).

Novel part of method is **structured learning**: fancy term for using input/predicting output that
