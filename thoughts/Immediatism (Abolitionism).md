# Immediatism (Abolitionism)
They believed in immediate, uncompensated emancipation, unlike [[Gradualism]], which was more moderate, but usually did not want to use violence.

They typically used **narratives** as their form of writing for convincing people to support their cause.

Examples:
- **American Anti-Slavery Society** (1831)
	- Split to the American Anti-Slavery Society and American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society over the issue of woman’s rights
- William Lloyd Garrison
- Frederick Douglass
- Harriet Tubman
- David Walker: a free African American who advocated for violence to challenge slavery
- Sojourner Truth
- Harriet Beecher Stowe
- Garrison and Douglass both were champions of woman’s rights
 
 In general, abolitionists were more social reformers than [[Gradualism|gradualists]].
