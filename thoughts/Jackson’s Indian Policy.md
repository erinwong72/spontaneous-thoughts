# Jackson’s Indian Policy
“**Five Civilized Tribes**” were those that assimilated a lot into white societies, with many having slaves, written language, similar architecture.

More and more white settlers wanted to expand into tribal lands for cotton-growing.

Indian Removal Act (1830): any new treaty with Natives would provide for their removal/reallocation to lands west of the Mississippi (instead of shrinking their lands further).
