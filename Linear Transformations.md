# Linear Transformations
Transformations are basically functions, but for sets.

Types: (here mapping V → W)
- $image(T)$ = collection of all vectors in W that can be gotten by transformation (by T) from V
- Injective: the transformation is one-to-one → distinct vectors will have distinct images
- Surjective: $image(T) = W$ → image of T spans the all of W
- Linear (mostly applied to transformations): image of linear combination = linear combination of images → **preserves** linear transformations

Determining if it’s a linear transformation:
Check general definition by setting arbitrary $\alpha\  \text{and}\ \beta$ and then carry out standard operations.

Given that it’s a linear transformation find the function/transformation itself:
