I raised my bow, its weight heavy in my hand, about to start my rendition of J. S. Bach’s fourth cello suite again. Nurses, hospital staff, and families bustled around me but I took no note. Every Sunday I would spend three hours at the hospital playing live music in the front lobby and every Sunday it would be the same routine -- I would set up, start playing, take a few short breaks, and then pack up and leave -- but this Sunday was different.
