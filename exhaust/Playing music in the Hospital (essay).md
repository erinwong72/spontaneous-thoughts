I raised my bow, its weight heavy in my hand, about to start my rendition of J. S. Bach’s fourth cello suite again. Nurses, hospital staff, and families bustled around me but I took no note. Every Sunday I would spend three hours at the hospital playing live music in the front lobby and every Sunday it would be the same routine -- I would set up, start playing, take a few short breaks, and then pack up and leave -- but this Sunday was different. Just as I gently lowered my bow to the C string, left hand hovering over the E flat, a man cleared his throat. Startled, I looked up, surprised to see a tall middle-aged man only a few feet away. 

“My mother is dying today.” He walked closer.

“She loved classical music and she would be so happy to hear it live, played just for her as she passes. Would you be willing to come up to the ICU and play for her a bit?”

I gaped at him, still trying to comprehend his request. Perhaps it was the stark contrast to the usual monotony or just the suddenness of it all, but when it finally dawned on me that this man was watching his mother slowly slip away from him, I knew I had to play for them. There was no better way for me to use my skills than to make others happy or at ease, even during their very last moments.

As I entered the ICU, I heard the familiar hospital sounds of heart rate monitors beeping and oxygen tanks pumping, but at the same time felt the somber mood that swept through the whole floor.
