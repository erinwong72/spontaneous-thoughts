I raised my bow, its weight heavy in my hand, about to start my rendition of J. S. Bach’s fourth cello suite again. Nurses, hospital staff, and families bustled around me but I took no note. Every Sunday I would spend three hours at the hospital playing live music in the front lobby and every Sunday it would be the same routine -- I would set up, start playing, take a few short breaks, and then pack up and leave -- but this Sunday was different. Just as I gently lowered my bow to the C string, left hand hovering over the E flat, I heard the sound of footsteps quickly approaching. Startled, I looked up, surprised to see a tall middle-aged man only a few feet away. 

“My mother is dying today.” He walked closer. 

The busy hall full of doctors, nurses, and incoming patients and families was now empty. 

“She loved classical music and she would be so happy to hear it live, played just for her as she passes. Would you be willing to come up to the ICU and play for her a bit?”

I gaped at him, still trying to comprehend his request. Perhaps it was the stark contrast to the usual monotony or just the suddenness of it all, but when it finally dawned on me that this man was watching his mother slowly slip away from him, I knew I had to play for them. There was no better way for me to use my skills than to make others happy or at ease, even during their very last moments.

As I entered the ICU, I heard the familiar hospital sounds of heart rate monitors beeping and oxygen tanks pumping that occupied any other floor, but felt the somber mood that swept through the whole floor. Finally reaching the door to the mother’s room, I paused. It was my last chance to turn back. Without much further thought, I stepped into the room. There laid the dying mother, in the midst of her loving family: the middle-aged guy, his sister, and his older brother. Quickly unpacking my cello, I overheard snippets of their conversation.

“Look, mom, she’s here to play you your favorite music!” 

I chose to play a sad and melancholic movement from Bach’s fifth suite, beautiful yet mournful. With chords reminiscent of wailing cries and elegant melodic lines, it captured the pain and suffering the family had gone through. Pouring everything I had into the performance, I felt the tension in the room relax, slowly ebbing away. As I left, I looked back to see the family huddled together, saying their final farewells.

That Sunday, I walked out of the hospital at the end of my shift not just a little wiser but invigorated, motivated to go and share music with others.

I later reached out to several nursing homes to perform for the elderly, hoping to use music to brighten their day. As I continued coming back to perform, I slowly got to know the “regulars” who showed up every week excited to listen to everything I had prepared for them. Every week, some would came to just listen while others would strike up conversations with me afterwards, eager to have someone to talk to. Through my weekly performances, I met so many people who had been touched by music at some point in their lives, their memories brought back by my playing. An former opera singer told me the most wonderful stories about her career, the people she encountered and the feeling of being on stage. A pianist, hands now wrinkled with age, came up to tell me about the time he accompanied a cellist playing the same piece I had just performed. Still, ordinary people, hobbyists and non-musicians, came to talk to me too, expressing how the pieces I played made them feel, sharing the memories they recalled. Everyone had been touched by the music in a different way, but touched nonetheless.
