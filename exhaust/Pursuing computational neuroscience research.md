The merging of computational tools such as deep learning with neuroscience is incredibly valuable and effective. Deep learning algorithms borrow architectures from the structure of the human brain, as can be seen by the fact that each unit of a deep learning model is typically called a “neuron”. Thus, they can easily be trained as a “digital twin” of a particular organisms’ brain, given the associated input. Leveraging such methods has led to breakthroughs in understanding processes like vision, sleep, and movement.
