I’ve always loved reading. It was all the entertainment I knew when I was younger: whenever I wasn’t sleeping or eating I was probably reading. Although I knew that the stories were not truths, I constantly compared my life to those of characters, which were immortalized through the stories. Unlike them, I wouldn’t always remain six years old; in my life, time steadily marched on. More than once, I questioned these very constructs of our lives, at the same time amazed and scared of the passage of time. In novels, it always seemed like time stopped for the main character, controlled by their desires and wishes, but in real life, that could not be any further from the truth. Yet, in some way, I felt like I could “control” how fast I perceived time passing -- time seemed to rush by as I grew older and more busy. But how?

The answer, I later came to understand, laid in a field called neuroscience.

My first encounter with neuroscience was again, through books. One day, when I was maybe seven or eight, having exhausted the new load of books I had just borrowed from the library a few days prior, I scanned all the bookshelves in the house for something, anything to read. After some time of running my fingers over the spines, my gaze landed on a thin, unassuming picture book. From the spine, I could only make out the last word, “hospital”. I gently lifted it off the shelf and flipped through the pages. As a squeamish child, I covered my eyes at the sight of any blood, skipping all the gory parts. However, one image remained imprinted in my memory, one of the brain divided into its usual five lobes. For some reason, this diagram caught my attention. To eight-year-old me, it was fascinating how structured our brains were -- they weren’t just big bowls of soup with thoughts floating around. 

Time continued to pass, more quickly as I entered middle school. In seventh grade biology, I was captivated during the nervous system unit, learning about the cerebellum, cerebrum, central and peripheral nervous systems. Even as I consumed all this new information, I continued to ask even more questions not only about myself but about others around me. How do we all recognize each other? How am I able to understand what’s going on around me through my five senses -- how do I really see/hear/touch/taste the environment? I was able to understand and answer a few questions to a shallow degree (we see through photoreceptors in our eyes converting light to electrical signals), but most remained unanswered, a motivation for further investigation.

Through it all, time still kept on ticking, and I was now in high school. Finally, as a freshman, I started seriously studying neuroscience. Immersed in the field, I continued to build up my knowledge and understanding of the field, finding likeminded peers in Discord servers and growing closer to my biology teacher at school, engaging in discussions. 

Each day, I woke up eager to discover something new that would shift my perspective of myself and the world. By my sophomore year, I wanted to become involved in making new breakthroughs in the ever-expanding field. As I had already learned the foundations for machine learning, I was interested in applying such techniques to research questions in neuroscience. 

Alongside all this, I eventually went on to win the Long Island Regional Brain Bee at Hofstra last year, prompting further exploration than I had ever gone in subfields like neuroanatomy, neurohistology, and neurological disorders. At the National Brain Bee, I had the opportunity to witness and interact with preserved neurological tissue. From the moment I first picked up a human brain in the lab, still drenched in formaldehyde, I was in awe. This brain I was holding once belonged to a person with thoughts, feelings, and dreams and I was [insert adjective] that something so abstract came out of this chunk of tissue. It was then when it all clicked: I was certain that I wanted to become a neurosurgeon.

Nowadays, with rates of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s an
