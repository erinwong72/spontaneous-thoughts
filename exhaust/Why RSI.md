I am, by nature, a curious person. When I was little, I was that kid who always asked “Why?”. Why does the train move? Why are there hairless cats? Why are we alive? Having grown up quite a bit, this hasn’t changed. I still raise my hand in class to ask questions that may seem obvious or dumb and I continue to seek out answers. This quest for knowledge has led me to research a variety of topics, from genomics to neuroscience to even molecular physics, and has now led me to this very program.

I first heard of RSI from my research teacher. She described it as a haven for exploration and discovery, a place where you could go investigate niche topics, a place where research has no limits. Naturally, I was fascinated by the prospect of piloting my own research, as I am passionate about a vast array of interests. As I researched the program in more detail, trying to understand what exactly it was all about, I came to see that it was more than your usual research camp -- it guides students through the whole research process, end to end. Because there are few opportunities for a high school student like me to learn academic writing and improve on communicating my research to others, that strongly appeals to me. Moreover, attending RSI would nurture my curiosity further: I would look forward to diving deep into my many ideas with top-of-the-field researchers and professors. Not only would I take every opportunity to learn from prominent researchers, but I would also consult fellow like-minded students. Really, the possibilities of what could be achieved at RSI and what contributions I could make to science are endless, and that is what excites me the most
